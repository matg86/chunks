Chunks - TO DO list project manager

Chunks is in the early stages of development. 

The concept in terms of interface is to keep your To DO list as clean and efficient as possible.

Lists will be made using headings of main tasks and then broken down in to smaller chunks. 
Although this is not a new concept, it is a proven one. This project will work best if all of the bells and whistles
are stripped away, leaving the user to note down their tasks in a clear and concise manner and then get on with the job.

Initially the site will be web based. It will be a one use basis until the back end is built.
Once the backend structure is there, users will be able to log in and retrieve their lists.
